When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I would want to use a remote repository to keep my codes online so that I can work on
  it from any other computers. Also, with a remote repo, I can share my codes so others
  can work on it too.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	There may be others who are working on the same branch and push on the remote which
	I wouldn't want to add to my local repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

	Fork: Save someone else's github repo to my github repo.
	Clone: Save any github repo to local computer or copy a local repo to somewhere 
	else locally.
	Branch: Create a branch for adding separate functionality.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	So I can compare the local master and origin/master when I am offline and make
	necessary changes/merges when I think appropriate.
