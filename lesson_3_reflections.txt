When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I would want to use a remote repository to keep my codes online so that I can work on
  it from any other computers. Also, with a remote repo, I can share my codes so others
  can work on it too.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	There may be others who are working on the same branch and push on the remote which
	I wouldn't want to add to my local repo.
