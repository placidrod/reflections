What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A .git directory is created in the working directory. I need it to
	implement version control in the directory I am working on.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area only includes the changes that have been added for commit.
	Working directory contains all files in the current directory and repository
	contains all the commits.

	Staging area provides opportunity to choose which changes I want to commit.
